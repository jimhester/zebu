# zebu

## Description

The `zebu` R package implements different tools related to local association measures in three main functions. It replaces the previous web application written using `shiny`.

- `lassie` estimates local (and global) association measures: Ducher's Z, pointwise mutual information and normalized pointwise mutual information.

- `permtest` accesses the significance of local (and global) association values using  p-values estimated by permutations.

- `subgroups` identifies if the association between variables is dependent on the value of another variable.

## Installation

Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Get the released version from CRAN:
```R
install.packages("zebu")
```

or the development version from Github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("olivmrtn/zebu")
```

## Usage and Theory
