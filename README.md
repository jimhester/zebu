# zebu

## Description

The `zebu` R package implements different tools related to local association measures in three main functions. It replaces the previous web application written using `shiny`.

- `lassie` estimates local (and global) association measures: Ducher's Z, pointwise mutual information and normalized pointwise mutual information.

- `permtest` accesses the significance of local (and global) association values using  p-values estimated by permutations.

- `subgroups` identifies if the association between variables is dependent on the value of another variable.

## Installation
